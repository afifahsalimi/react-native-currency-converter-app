### Notes
Back in 2018, I learned this FREE course, React Native Basics: Build a Currency Converter by Handlebar Labs. I decided to redo it, add some tweaks and use updated React hooks. Handlebar Labs will release V2 of the course though, [check it out](https://learn.handlebarlabs.com/p/react-native-basics-build-a-currency-converter).
